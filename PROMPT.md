Perfect! Here's the fully **cleaned, professional version** of your project plan with the following updates:

* ✅ You’ve already **completed the Auth Service** — it will now serve as the **BaseApp** for all other microservices.
* ✅ You've also **completed the CRM Service** — it follows the same structure and components as the Auth Service.
* ✅ All other services will **inherit structure, features, and components** from these completed services.

## ✅ BaseApp: `auth-service` (Complete)

Your `auth-service` now serves as the **BaseApp template**. All future microservices will be cloned from it to ensure consistency in:

* Laravel Jetstream + Inertia + React setup
* ShadCN UI component library
* MySQL (via XAMPP) integration
* Shared database architecture
* i18n, theming, and role-based dashboards
* Development conventions (TypeScript, Inertia, hooks)

### ✅ Clone for New Microservices:

```bash
cp -r auth-service project-service
cp -r auth-service crm-service
cp -r auth-service billing-service
# ... and so on
```

---

## 🧱 Microservices Breakdown

Each of the following services will be its **own Laravel Jetstream + Inertia + React project** cloned from `auth-service`:

1. **Project & Task Management** (with time tracking)
2. **CRM / Client Management** (with real-time chat)
3. **Billing & Invoicing**
4. **HR & Team Collaboration**
5. **Support Ticketing**
6. **Developer Resource Hub**
7. **Analytics & Reporting Dashboard**

---

## 🔁 Shared Features (Inherited from Auth Service)

All microservices must include the following:

### 🔧 UI/UX & Frontend:

* ✅ ShadCN UI (40+ styled components)
* ✅ Dark/Light mode toggle
* ✅ Responsive design (mobile + desktop)
* ✅ Inertia.js + React pages
* ✅ Role-based dashboards:

  * Admin: system-wide stats
  * Manager: team/project overviews
  * User: personal tasks/activity
* ✅ Role-based navigation (using `usePermissions`)
* ✅ Multilingual support via `i18next` (English + Zambian languages: Bemba `bem`, Nyanja `nya`, Tonga `toi`)
* ✅ Toast notifications (via `sonner`)
* ✅ Charts/visualizations (via Recharts)
* ✅ Language switcher from `@/Components/LanguageSwitcher`

### 📬 Email & Notifications:

* ✅ Mailtrap for dev, SMTP for prod
* ✅ Notification triggers:

  * Task assignment, updates, and completion
  * Overdue reminders
  * Verification & registration emails

### 🔌 Backend Infrastructure:

* ✅ RESTful API via `routes/api.php`
* ✅ Laravel Policies + Form Requests for permission & validation
* ✅ Shared database (auth-service owns `users`, `roles`, `permissions`)
* ✅ Microservices expose their own APIs
* ✅ HTTP inter-service communication (Axios or Laravel Guzzle)
* ✅ Independent auth per service (no SSO)

---

## 🧠 Auth & JWT Token Architecture

* Auth handled **only** by `auth-service`
* Other services **validate JWT tokens** issued by auth-service
* `.env` per service must set:

  ```env
  APP_URL=http://localhost:800X
  SESSION_DOMAIN=null
  SESSION_SAME_SITE=lax
  ```

---

## 🛠 Setup Checklist for Each New Microservice

1. **Clone from `auth-service`**
2. Update `.env` with service-specific `APP_NAME` and `APP_URL`
3. Replace domain logic (models, migrations, routes, pages)
4. Add new components/pages using ShadCN + Inertia

---

## 📊 Microservice Features

### All Services Must Include:

* CRUD for all domain entities (projects, tasks, clients, etc.)
* Proper permission handling
* Role-based dashboards
* Validation via Laravel Form Requests
* Email notifications
* REST API routes
* Charts/visuals with Recharts
* Localization files (`resources/js/i18n/locales/en|bem|nya|toi/translation.json`)

---
