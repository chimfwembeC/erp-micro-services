   - Configure access to all microservices

2. Create API endpoints for n8n:
   - Each microservice should expose webhook endpoints for n8n
   - Implement authentication for n8n to access these endpoints

3. Implement workflows:
   - Start with simple workflows like task notifications
   - Progress to more complex workflows like CRM-to-Billing sync
   - Set up scheduled workflows for reports and backups
