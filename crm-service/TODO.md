2. Implemented direct login in the CRM service
3. Updated routes to remove SSO dependencies
4. Updated environment configuration
5. Removed subdomain configuration

- [ ] Add user registration functionality
- [ ] Add password reset functionality
- [ ] Add email verification
- [ ] Add remember me functionality

### Database Setup

- [ ] Set up proper database migrations for users
- [ ] Create seeders for test users
- [ ] Implement user roles and permissions

### UI Improvements

- [ ] Update login and register pages with proper styling
- [ ] Add form validation
- [ ] Add loading states
- [ ] Add error handling

### Testing

- [ ] Add unit tests for authentication
- [ ] Add feature tests for login and registration
- [ ] Add browser tests for authentication flow

## How to Run the CRM Service

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the crm-service directory
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer install
   npm install
   ```
3. Copy .env.example to .env:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Generate application key:
   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```
5. Run migrations:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```
6. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```
7. In a separate terminal, start the Vite development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
8. Access the CRM service at http://localhost:8001

## Notes

- Authentication is currently bypassed for development purposes
- When you click login or register, you'll be redirected directly to the dashboard
- No actual authentication checks are performed
- This is a temporary solution until proper authentication is implemented
