# Mailtrap Configuration Success

The Mailtrap email service has been successfully configured for your TekRem auth-service. This means that all emails sent from your application will be captured by Mailtrap for testing purposes.

## Current Configuration

```
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=sandbox.smtp.mailtrap.io
MAIL_PORT=2525
MAIL_USERNAME=e37f6af57512a8
MAIL_PASSWORD=0023843dd4ce4f
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="noreply@tekrem.com"
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```

## Testing Email Functionality

You can test the email functionality using the following command:

```bash
php artisan email:test test@example.com
```

This will send a test email to the specified address, which will be captured by Mailtrap.

## Viewing Emails in Mailtrap

To view the emails sent by your application:

1. Log in to your Mailtrap account at https://mailtrap.io/
2. Navigate to your inbox
3. You should see all emails sent by your application

## Email Features in Auth Service

The following email features are now working:

- User registration verification emails
- Password reset emails
- Team invitation emails (if using teams feature)
- Any custom emails sent by your application

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with email sending:

1. Check that your Mailtrap credentials are correct
2. Verify that your Mailtrap account is active
3. Try using a different port (587, 465) if port 2525 is blocked
4. Check your application logs for any error messages

## Next Steps

Now that email functionality is working, you can:

1. Test the user registration flow with email verification
2. Test the password reset functionality
3. Implement any custom email notifications needed for your application

## Production Environment

For production, you'll want to replace Mailtrap with a real email service like:

- Amazon SES
- SendGrid
- Mailgun
- Postmark

When switching to production, update your `.env` file with the appropriate credentials for your chosen email service.
